# Parking Garage Project
# Jack Nolan: 
<p> Forked from Alexandra's repository. I was the "GPS" for the first portion while she physically drove.
We then switched roles roughly 3 times. Fixed takeTicket method to account for full parking garage and added
removeDriver method which checks out a driver, makes them pay, and then updates the available list.
